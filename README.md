# Hello world, I'm Brittany!

- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm a 32-year-old self-taught fullstack web developer helping immigrants around the world transition into a career in tech. Not the best coder in the world, but I don't care, I think it's fun and is one of the main outlets that perfectly blends creativity and collaboration to help solve complex problems!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: My nonprofit's first website project. Check it out here: [Coding For Immigrants Website Repository](https://github.com/Coding-For-Immigrants/website "CFI's Website Repository")
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: React
- 💬 Ask me about: Scrum, fascilitation, leadership, being an immigrant, workplace equity for bipoc, drag race
- 📫 How to reach me: Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmvillegas/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to compete professionally in jam rollerskating competitions. I still skate today, mostly at skateparks on ramps and in bowls.
